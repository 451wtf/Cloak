# ðŸ¦¸ Cloak OS **â†’** 451.wtf's OS based on our Silhouette Kernel
CloakOS is an OS made by 451.wtf which are F(L)OSS and Privacy enthusiasts for people who:
- want to try something new.
- want an OS which is easy to use.
- want an OS where Updates don't brick the System.
- want an OS which is noob-proof.
- want an OS easy on resources.

The OS and our Kernel are both written in Zig, for learning purposes and to make the internet a more private place.

> [!CAUTION]
> Nothing here mentioned is applicable to the OS as of August 21st 2025.
> This OS is NOT functional. Our main focus is the [Silhouette Kernel](https://codeberg.org/451/Silhouette)

## Focus
**â†’** Privacy Â» No tracking, no telemetry. Block domains, IPs or Ports for Apps or the complete OS and easily configure the Firewall. Sandbox apps natively with one click. <br/>
**â†’** Usability Â» Install, uninstall and update Software easily using our App Store or CLI Tool. <br/>
**â†’** Design Â» We try to make everything as modern as possible, from the Developer API to the Userland of Cloak. <br/>
**â†’** Built-in Software Â» DeadDrop is our own Chat App made for extreme privacy, Arc is our own IDE with a focus on Privacy, Usability and Simplicity. Both can be uninstalled. <br/>
